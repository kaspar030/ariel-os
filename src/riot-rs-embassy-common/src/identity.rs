/// # Evolution
///
/// In its current state, this type is mainly a wrapper around a binary identifier.
///
/// As it is used more, additional methods can be provided for concrete types of identifiers, such
/// as MAC addresses. By default, those would be generated in some way from what is available in
/// the identifier -- but devices where the identifier already *is* a MAC address (or possibly a
/// range thereof) can provide their official addresses.
pub trait DeviceId: Sized {
    /// Some `[u8; N]` type, returned by [`.bytes()`][Self::bytes].
    ///
    /// This may not represent all the identifying information available on the device, but can
    /// represent a unique portion thereof.
    ///
    /// (For example, if a device has two consecutive MAC addresses assigned, the type as a whole
    /// may represent both, but the conventional serialized identity of the device may just be one
    /// of them).
    ///
    /// # Evolution
    ///
    /// In the long run, it will be preferable to add a `const BYTES_LEN: usize;` and enforce the
    /// type `[u8; Self::BYTES_LEN]` as the return value of [`.bytes(_)]`][Self::bytes]. This can
    /// not be done yet as it depends on the `generic_const_exprs` feature.
